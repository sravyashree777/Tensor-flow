## TensorFlow Probability

A Powerful Library for Probabilistic Modeling and Inference

# Introduction {#Introduction}

TensorFlow Probability (TFP) is an open-source software library on TensorFlow for probabilistic modeling and statistical inference. TFP is a complete toolkit for probability distributions, uncertainty estimation, and Bayesian machine learning.

In conventional deep learning, models tend to produce deterministic predictions, where they provide one value without considering uncertainty. Yet in real-world domains such as finance, medicine, and robotics, uncertainty matters. TensorFlow Probability assists by making probabilistic reasoning possible, which enables models to provide estimates of confidence levels and make better-informed decisions.

# Installation & Setup {#Installation-Setup}
Install the latest version of TensorFlow Probability:
```py
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-probability
```
the other way to intall it is
## Install from source
```py
  sudo apt-get install bazel git python-pip
  python -m pip install --upgrade --user tf-nightly
  git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/probability.git
  cd probability
  bazel build --copt=-O3 --copt=-march=native :pip_pkg
  PKGDIR=$(mktemp -d)
  ./bazel-bin/pip_pkg $PKGDIR
  python -m pip install --upgrade --user $PKGDIR/*.whl
```
